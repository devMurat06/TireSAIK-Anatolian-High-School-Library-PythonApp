# 📚 Tire ŞAİK Anatolian High School - Library Management System

This is a comprehensive Library Management System developed for **Tire Şehit Albay İbrahim Karaoğlanoğlu (ŞAİK) Anatolian High School** to digitize library processes and streamline book tracking.

As a 10th-grade student, I developed this project to modernize the borrowing/return system in my school and reduce paper waste through a digital-first approach.
